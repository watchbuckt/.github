# Welcome to **Watchbuckt**!

I am aiming to build an indie platform that provides a better user experience for movie nerds like me. ðŸŽ¥

It's also an opportunity for me as a developer to dive into new stacks and concepts. ðŸ¤“

Any suggestions, contributions, or feedback are welcomed. The community is part of why I've chosen to build in public.

### ðŸš€ Roadmap:

- [ ] The base platform:
  - Web: Next app-router.
  - Mobile: React-Native/Expo.
  - Use the same UI library across both.
  - Integrate TheMovieDB and/or other sources for content.
  - Probably MongoDB
- [ ] Social Media element:
  - We aim to be more than just a list.
  - Probably SQL
- [ ] Suggestions Engine (I am tired of not finding what to watch next)
  - Some python
  - Probably some graph database on the side.
